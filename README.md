## üöÄ Installation

Getting started is simple. All you need is Python 3.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required dependency:**
    The application uses `feedparser` to handle RSS feeds.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    _(Note: `tkinter` is usually included with Python. If not, you may need to install it separately, e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu)._

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    The news ticker will appear at the bottom of your screen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the ticker by editing the `src/config.py` file. The file is well-commented and allows you to change a wide range of settings.

### Adding & Changing RSS Feeds

To change the news sources, simply edit the `FEED_URLS` list in `src/config.py`. You can add any valid RSS feed URL.

```python
# src/config.py

FEED_URLS = [
    # Add your favorite RSS feeds here
    "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml",
    "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Technology.xml",
    "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml",
    # "https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index",
]
```

### Customizing Appearance

Modify variables like `BG_COLOR`, `FG_COLOR`, `FONT_FAMILY`, `FONT_SIZE`, `SCROLL_DELAY_MS`, and `TICKER_HEIGHT_PX` to change the look and feel.

```python
# src/config.py

# Colors
BG_COLOR = "#000000"  # Black background
FG_COLOR = "#FFA500"  # Orange text

# Font Settings
FONT_FAMILY = "Courier New"
FONT_SIZE = 14

# Behavior
SCROLL_DELAY_MS = 30  # Lower is faster
```

    *   `Pause/Resume` the scrolling.
    *   `Show/Hide Descriptions` for the headlines.
*   **Press `Esc`**: Closes the application.
